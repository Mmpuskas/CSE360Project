# How to run
The easiest way to play the game is to download the latest executable jar from the "Release" tab.

The program can also be compiled, unit tested, and ran as normal.
When compiling, the build on master will be the most up-to-date. The main program can be built from src/ui/Driver.java

This program now automatically adjusts screen resolution depending on the user's current display resolution.
