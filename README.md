# How to run
Due to issues in packaging the game, the most recent build must be compiled in eclipse, instead of ran by using an executable jar.
When compiling, the build on master will be the most up-to-date. The game can be built from src/ui/Driver.java

Tests can be ran from src/ui/JUnitTest.java

This program now automatically adjusts screen resolution depending on the user's current display resolution.
