2. As a player I want to move my character based on the dice roll so that I can play the game.
3. As a player I want to press the play button so that I can begin the game.
4. As a player I want to press the leaderboard button so that I can see the top scores.


** There aren't many user stories since we only have one type of user, with a limited amount of player verbs (Press play button, press leaderboard button, press roll button.) **
